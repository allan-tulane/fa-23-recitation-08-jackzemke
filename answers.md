    - My algorithm is essentially just a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm, with the only modification being an additional data point in the tuple representing each node in the heap. Therefore, the work and span of my implimentation are the same as the work and span for Dijkstra's algorith, which are $W(n) = O(|E| \log |E|)$ and $S(n) = O(|E| \log |E|)$.
